# Video tutorials
For a couple of years we have had a couple of short video tutorials that Jonathan and me (Peter) has made. We gonna redo them and we feel that now is the time for you to help us make more and better tutorials! 

A couple of things:
* Make the tutorial in English
* If you want to sync with us first or need help with your setup, you can talk to us on [our Slack channel](https://sitespeedio.herokuapp.com) or in a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/new).
* Follow our [code of conduct](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
* We need the original video (how to share it?)

## What's in it for you?
You will make it easier for people to use sitespeed.io. Sitespeed.io is open source, free, we believe in privacy, and ...

You will get a special sticker pack with one exclusive sitespeed.io sticker!

Here's an exmaple of some of our stickers:
